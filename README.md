# REST Currency Client

A simple REST client for receiving up to date currency exchange rates. Parses 
JSON to java objects. 

Made as a school exercise for ITHS' course on web
services in 2019.

Obtains currency exchange rates in JSON-format from server using
REST and stores them as a POJO (plain old java object)
